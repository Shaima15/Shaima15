## About

Hello, I am Sheyma, a Data Analyst Candidate at the University of South Dakota. Before pursuing this pathway, I worked as a Marketing Coordinator in an Advertising technology and saw how data can be utilised to empower e-commerce business, making me passionate about all things **_analytics_**. My academic journey featured several hands-on analytical projects that allowed me to analyze data using Python, R Studio, SQL, and SAS studio. Furthermore, I worked as a Data Analytics Student Consultant at the University of South Dakota, where I honed my analytics and visualization skills. 

In my free time, I work on personal projects with the goal of learning new skills and statistical methods in order to expand my knowledge. My work and educational experiences allowed me to develop my technical skills which I am eager to demonstrate as an entry-level Data Scientist.
